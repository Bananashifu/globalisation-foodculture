								<h3>Conclusion</h3>
								<h4>What is your final response to the issue? What have you learnt from this research? Has it affected you?</h4>
								<p>My final response to the issue is that while some people are wary of this becoming a bigger problem, I do not think that modification and change of traditional dishes is a bad thing and only a bad thing. The reason for this is that it is impossible to preserve everything of a culture, may it be a song, a story, or a traditional food dish. I think that change is good, as long as it acknowledges where the change came from and that there is a link to its past.</p>
								<p id="biblio">However, we must be careful of the effect fast food chains have on many people, who don’t know of any other food as cheap or as tasty or as quick, as these are the three main attractive factors of fast food. That is why people must be made aware of other food that is cheap, tasty, and quick, but also healthy. A further extension of this would be home cooking, where people can follow the whole process of how their food is made, and also control everything that goes into their food.</p>
