								<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
									<p>My research question is ‘How does globalisation change/affect a country’s
										food culture?’ I will be investigating the change that has been brought upon 
										traditional food dishes as a result of the world becoming more connected. I 
										think that this change will become more and more evident as time goes on and 
										technology continues to advance. This is one of the reasons why this topic is 
										so interesting.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
									<p>This is an important issue as it is a change on the global scale, meaning it will 
										affect everybody in the world. When it comes to change, there are always two 
										sides - one to back up, and one to oppose the issue. Modernisation of traditional
										food dishes is no different – there are people who support this  change, while at 
										the same time there are people who are against it.</p>

							<h2>The Issue</h2>
							<p>Its causes, impacts and effects</p>
						</header>
						<p>The issue surrounding my topic is the fear that some traditional dishes are going to go extinct not only because of recipe changes, but also of other factors such as American fast food chains and popularisation of foreign dishes. Recipes, tastes, ingredients, etc. change because of the countries that they have moved to and the people who reside there. Additionally, fast food has become increasingly popular because of its tastiness, and ease, which makes it such a desirable choice in a world where everything is becoming so instant.</p>

							<h2>'Food Culture'</h2>
							<p>What does this mean and how do I define it?</p>
						</header>
						<p>Food culture is the many aspects of a particular country's food and cuisine. A country's food culture is what makes it unique from other country's dishes; for example, ingredients, tastes, consumption habits, flavour mixtures, or a combination of all of the above. Food culture is an integral part of a country's entire culture. In my opinion, it is one of the main parts that defines a culture. This is why massive change of food culture worries so many people - if such an important part of culture changes so drastically, there many be unforseen effects for the culture as a whole. </p>
